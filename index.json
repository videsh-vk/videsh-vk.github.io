This often leads to discomfort, improper fit, and reduced patient compliance during prolonged use. This project addresses these limitations through the design of a universally adjustable cervical collar that emphasizes ergonomic fit, improved airflow, and effective occipital support to enhance comfort, rehabilitation, and everyday usability. This project was completed by a team of three as part of the Prototyping and Testing course.\nDesign Concept The proposed design addresses these limitations through a universally adjustable cervical collar focused on adaptability, comfort, and stability.\nThe concept draws inspiration from everyday objects such as a tennis ball placed atop a shuttlecock, symbolizing a stable yet adaptable support structure. This analogy informed the development of a scissor-inspired lifting mechanism that enables precise height adjustment to match individual neck anatomy.\nOnce adjusted, the mechanism can be securely locked in place, allowing the collar to fit a wide range of neck sizes while maintaining structural integrity.\nMy Contributions (Lead Designer) Led the conceptual design and mechanical architecture of the cervical collar Developed the shuttlecock–tennis ball inspired geometry for adaptive support Designed the scissor-based height adjustment mechanism and locking system Defined ergonomic requirements for neck fit, airflow, and occipital support Produced primary CAD models and coordinated design iterations with the team Guided prototyping decisions based on manufacturability and usability Key Design Features Height Adjustability Scissor-based mechanism enables controlled vertical adjustment Accommodates variations in neck length and anatomy Ensures proper immobilization without excessive pressure Improved Airflow Open structural design promotes ventilation Reduces heat and moisture buildup during extended wear Enhances comfort and long-term usability Occipital Support Provides targeted support to the occipital region Improves cervical spine stabilization Limits excessive head and neck motion during rehabilitation Impact Developed as part of a structured prototyping and testing course, this project demonstrates a patient-centric design approach that improves adaptability and comfort over traditional fixed-size cervical collars.
